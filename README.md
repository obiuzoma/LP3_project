### Introduction


This project focuses on time series forecasting to predict store sales for Corporation Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer. The objective is to build a model that accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores

## Hypothesis
 
 Null Hypothesis: The type of holiday does not have any significant on the increase of sales
 
 Alternative Hypothesis: The type of holiday has significant impact on the increase in sales
 
 ## Questions

The questions below are to be answered. Do note that, you are free to draw more hypothesis from the data.

1. Is the train dataset complete (has all the required dates)?

2. Which dates have the lowest and highest sales for each year?

3. Did the earthquake impact sales?

4. Are certain groups of stores selling more products? (Cluster, city, state, type)

5. Are sales affected by promotions, oil prices and holidays?

6. What analysis can we get from the date and its extractable features?

7. What is the difference between RMSLE, RMSE, MSE (or why is the MAE greater than all of them?)

Your task is to build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items.
